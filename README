= Greedy Page

A page that will return for any url that implies a child page.

Examples (assume a page at "/", a GreedyPage at "/greedy/", and a child at "/greedy/child/"):
* "/" returns the real root page
* "/greedy/child/" returns the real child page
* "/greedy/no-real-page/" returns the real page (which will claim to have the url  requested)
